# Contributing to IDSA Github Repositories

This is the working repository of [IDSA](https://www.internationaldataspaces.org) on identities and identifiers in Data Spaces.

All issues and pull requests need to be discussed in the Working Group meetings.

All content published here is provided and approved by the Working Group Architecture. You are very welcome to contribute to this repository when you find a bug, want to suggest an improvement, or have an idea for a useful feature. For this, always create an issue and a corresponding branch, and follow our style guides as described below.

Please note that we have a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that all contributors should stick to.

## Pre-read and references to the Rulebook
Please take a look at the following documents first to get some context before starting contributions:

* [IDSA Rulebook Functional Requirements](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-knowledgebase/v/idsa-rulebook/idsa-rulebook/3_functional_requirements)
* The Dataspace protocol at https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-knowledgebase/v/dataspace-protocol or https://github.com/eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base/DataspaceProtocol


We also kindly ask the authors to reference sections of the [IDSA Rulebook](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-knowledgebase/v/idsa-rulebook/idsa-rulebook/1_introduction) in their contributions, so we have ties between the RAM and the Rulebook.

## How to contribute

You can support this project in two different ways:

1. Create new content
1. or review content from other contributors and share your feedback through comments

**If you are interested in creating new content:**
* Check the [issues](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/identity-in-data-spaces/issues) to see the areas where we need contributions
* Once you find a topic of interest, make sure to read the previous sections of the paper and the Rulebook as described in [Pre-read and references to the Rulebook](#Pre-read and references to the Rulebook)
* Make a brief outline first in the related issue (even just in the form of a few bullet points), to share your initial ideas so you have a chance to get feedback from other contributors and maintainers before starting the writing process.
* After you align on the overall approach with others through the conversations on the issue, please create a new (branch](#Branches) to work on the actual writing on this topic
* Once you commit your content to the new branch you have just created, ask for a review by others by creating a pull request.
* Your pull request will appear in the list [here](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/identity-in-data-spaces/pulls), and you will get notified when the reviewers you have assigned to the pull request or other interested colleagues share their feedback through comments in the pull request.

**If you would like to review content from other contributors and share your thoughts:**

* Please take a look at the pull requests [here](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/identity-in-data-spaces/pulls)
* and add comments directly in the pull request you would like to have a say on.
* This will notify the original contributor of the issue and help them engage with you on your feedback

We believe this process will help foster a collaborative environment where contributors with different viewpoints can converge on a common approach. Thanks in advance for following it!


## Changelog

We document changes in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) on root level which is formatted and
maintained according to the rules documented on http://keepachangelog.com.

## Issues

You always have to create an issue if you want to propose a correction, improvement, or feature.
Briefly and clearly describe the purpose of your contribution in the corresponding issue.
The pre-defined [labels](#labels) improve the understanding of your intentions and help to follow
the scope of your changes.

**Bug Report**: As mentioned above, bug reports should be submitted as an issue. To give others
the chance to reproduce the error in order to find a solution as quickly as possible, the report
should at least include the following information:

* Description: What did you expect and what happened instead?
* Steps to reproduce (system specs included)
* Relevant logs and/or media (optional): e.g. an image

## Labels


The [labels](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/labels) are listed at the
[issues](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/idsa/issues).
There are two types of labels: one describes the content of the issue and should be used by the
developer that creates the issue. The other one, starting with `status`, will be added from the
developer that takes on the issue. New issues should be initially marked with `status:open`.

*  Basic labels: `bug`, `documentation` `duplicate`, `enhancement`, `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `invalid`, `question`, `wontfix`
*  `bug`: Something isn't working
*  `documentation`: Improvements or additions to documentation
*  `duplicate`: This issue or pull request already exists
*  `enhancement`: New feature or request
*  `good first issue`: Good for newcomers
*  `help wanted`: Extra attention is needed
*  `invalid`: This doesn't seem right
*  `question`: Further information is requested
*  `wontfix`: This will not be worked on


## Branches

After creating an issue yourself or if you want to address an existing issue, you have to create a
branch with a unique number and name that assigns it to an issue. Therefore, follow the guidelines
at https://deepsource.io/blog/git-branch-naming-conventions/. After your changes, update the
`README.md`, Wiki, and `CHANGELOG.md` with necessary details. Then, create a pull request and note
that **committing to the main branch is not allowed**. Please use the feature `linked issues` to
link issues and pull requests.

Pull requests have to be approved by the IDSA Head Office.

## Commits

We encourage all contributors to stick to the commit convention following the specification on
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). In general, use  the
imperative in the present tense. A quick overview of the schema:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
[optional body]
[optional footer(s)]
```

Types: `fix`, `feat`, `chore`, `test`, `refactor`, `docs`, `release`. Append `!` for breaking
changes to a type.

An example of a very good commit might look like this: `feat![login]: add awesome breaking feature`
